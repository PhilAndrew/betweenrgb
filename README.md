Notes.

Feel free to use any Java or Scala library you need to use to get the job done. If there is a library which can do
the maths for you then use it.

You may need to use Gradle or Ant or Maven to build and run. I assume you can make that work.

If there are multiple values for the solution of a problem then maybe one way to solve it is to return a function
which can tell if a RGB is within the solution space. A fitness function.
